                    <p>I am a passionate woman about knowledge, and the more I know, the more I want to learn. I am a Systems Engineer, but for many years I have been a teacher. I teach Computer Science and Technology classes at a school in the city of Bogotá. Additionally, I am a Python tutor at a foreign company. I am also pursuing a virtual Master's degree in "Educational Technologies." One of my upcoming goals is to improve my English level, complete my Master's degree, and graduate from Digital House.</p>

                    <p>I am a daughter, mother of Felipe, and I have a wonderful husband who supports me in all my projects. I enjoy creating things or objects with my hands. I had a woodworking workshop, but due to lack of time, I couldn't continue. I also worked on an editorial project for children called "Art History for Kids," but I had to put it on hold due to lack of time.</p>
